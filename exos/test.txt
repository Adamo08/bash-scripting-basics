1. Hello, world!
2. This is a test file for the filtering script.
3. It contains several lines of text: 42, 7, and 13.
4. Some lines will match specific patterns, like 100% and 50%.
5. For example, let's see if we can find the word 'test' in line 4.
6. Another line for testing with numbers: 1234567890.
7. This line is here just to confuse the pattern matching.
8. End of the test file. Remember, 3 is a magic number!
9. Special characters: #, $, %, &, and * are included.
10. Are you ready to test the script? 42 is the answer to life!
